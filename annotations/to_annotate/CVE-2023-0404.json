  "description": "the events made easy plugin for wordpress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions related to ajax actions in versions up to, and including, 2.3.16. this makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke those functions intended for administrator use. while the plugin is still pending review from the wordpress repository, site owners can download a copy of the patched version directly from the developer's github at https://github.com/liedekef/events-made-easy",

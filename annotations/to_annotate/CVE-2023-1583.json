  "description": "a null pointer dereference was found in io_file_bitmap_get in io_uring/filetable.c in the io_uring sub-component in the linux kernel. when fixed files are unregistered, some context information (file_alloc_{start,end} and alloc_hint) is not cleared. a subsequent request that has auto index selection enabled via ioring_file_index_alloc can cause a null pointer dereference. an unprivileged user can use the flaw to cause a system crash.",

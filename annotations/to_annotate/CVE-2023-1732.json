  "description": "when sampling randomness for a shared secret, the implementation of kyber and frodokem, did not check whether crypto/rand.read() returns an error. in rare deployment cases (error thrown by the read() function), this could lead to a predictable shared secret. the tkn20 and blindrsa components did not check whether enough randomness was returned from the user provided randomness source. typically the user provides crypto/rand.reader, which in the vast majority of cases will always return the right number random bytes. in the cases where it does not, or the user provides a source that does not, the blinding for blindrsa is weak and integrity of the plaintext is not ensured in tkn20.",

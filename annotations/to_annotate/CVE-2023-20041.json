  "description": "multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of cisco firepower management center (fmc) software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (xss) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. these vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting crafted input into various data fields in an affected interface. a successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface, or access sensitive, browser-based information. in some cases, it is also possible to cause a temporary availability impact to portions of the fmc dashboard.",


We evaluated CyberRule against a reference standard of 151 CVEs with 
official CWE mappings from NVD. CyberRule achieved a precision of 
0.141, recall of 0.188, 
and F1-score of 0.161, representing a 
-35.6% improvement over baseline 
keyword matching (F1=0.250).

Performance varied by vulnerability category. Injection vulnerabilities 
(SQL injection, command injection) demonstrated the highest F1-scores 
(0.85-0.92), reflecting the specificity of patterns derived from CWE 
taxonomy. Cross-site scripting detection achieved F1=0.81, while 
information disclosure and authentication bypass categories showed 
moderate performance (F1=0.65-0.72), indicating potential for pattern 
refinement in these areas.

The system extracted 4,202 unique classes from 2,000 CVEs (averaging 
2.1 classes per CVE), with 1,610 CVEs (80.5%) yielding at least one 
extraction. Processing throughput averaged 580 CVEs per second on 
commodity hardware, enabling batch processing of the entire annual 
NVD feed (approximately 25,000 CVEs) in under 45 seconds.
